# CMPSC 405, Deep Learning, Spring 2025

## Description

An interrogation of foundational capabilities, challenges and consequences of deep learning algorithms. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students master theoretical concepts to build and train neural network architectures and learn how to improve them. Leveraging insights and tools from an industry partner, students also investigate real-world cases such as speech recognition, machine translation, computer vision, and natural language processing. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## Course Learning Outcomes

1. Apply concepts from calculus and linear algebra to create predictive models that use a deep neural network.
2. Use Python to implement and interpret a multilayer neural network that can process various sources of data.
3. Use an existing deep learning model in an application for predictive data analysis and communicate the results effectively in both written and oral formats.
4. Evaluate, optimize, and improve the performance of a deep learning model with a focus on its ethical impact.
5. Build, train, test, document, and deploy a new deep learning model in a software application.
